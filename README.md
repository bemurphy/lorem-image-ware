# LoremImageWare

Rack middleware for proxying requests to [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com)

This mounts routing in your Rack stack so that paths like `/lorem/image/400/200` will
serve a 400x200 random image from lorempixel.com.

The middleware is primarily useful because it will cache responses from lorempixel so
that after a few page loads, images should load much faster.  Without such local
caching you will be stuck hammering their server on every page load, and waiting a
few seconds for images to fill in.

It is recommended to only load the middleware in development environments.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lorem-image-ware'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lorem-image-ware

## Usage

Mount in your app stack like:

```ruby
use LoremImageWare::Middleware
```

If you wish to serve off a directory other than the default `/lorem`, pass the `:root` option:

```ruby
use LoremImageWare::Middleware, :root => "/random_images"
```

There is a small Helpers module you can include for generating lorem image tags for you.  For example
in Sinatra classical:

```ruby
helpers LoremImageWare::Helpers

# In a view
lorem_image_tag(:height => 400, :width => 200, :tag => "sports", :class => "some-class")
```

The helper will add a class of `lorem-image` to tags for you, as well as populate the dimensions
and set inline height and width styling on the image.

## Todo

Use cache-control and ETag support for browser caching
